1
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,520
right.

2
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,150
Okay,

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,170
let's rub it out.

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,170
So keeping your friends under control Some of you may guess where this is already going,

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:26,090
but so imagine you have a class fare 

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,680
class badger,

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,110
of course.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,770
Why not Onda pastor members,

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,730
The creator instance of this class Badger notice.

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,330
It's in this name.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,220
Space animals.

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,070
Of course you can.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,870
You can call this free function that operates on on Bajor,

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,840
just as it is because we have arguments,

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,110
spending.

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:44,550
Look up.

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,770
So that's the polices.

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,280
So I haven't looked at this for a little while.

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,880
Of course,

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,810
you can also qualify that free function with the name space that is in and now works as 

21
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,040
well.

22
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,130
Then we're not using,

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,130
but interestingly,

24
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,750
if you put that free function inside the class as a friend 

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,900
on also make it in line.

26
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,940
This is now no longer findable using idea because it's technically not 

27
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,130
in that enclosing name space,

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,440
which means the only way Sorry.

29
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,140
The only way to find it is with a D l.

30
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,260
Let's get that the wrong way around.

31
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,000
So if you try to call it qualified of name space,

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,570
that's an error.

33
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,050
But if you call it unqualified ideal picks it up,

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,160
so I can't remember.

35
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,070
Why put this light in.

36
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,170
I know this is a bad idea,

37
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,470
but anyway,

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,970
what's the what's the benefit of this?

39
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,350
Is it just a curiosity?

40
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:48,770
Well,

41
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,550
imagine we're talking about operators.

42
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,970
The Austrian operator overload here.

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,250
Now we introduce another class that Z not in that name space.

44
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,960
If we introduce an era,

45
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,650
this is a sort of error message we're going to see.

46
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,690
I'm sure you're familiar with this.

47
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,190
In fact,

48
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,970
this is just an extract and hopefully you can read it all.

49
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,900
But in case you can't zoom in,

50
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,870
there's a bit that actually reflects the area that we introduced the rest of it's just 

51
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,460
noise coming from all the additional overloads that we're finding because of a d.

52
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:23,670
R.

53
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,970
So if we can hide all of these overloads from medial,

54
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,450
then we can drastically reduce the number of areas that we got,

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,460
and that sort of reflects the what we cut out.

56
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,150
But I'll zoom straight 

57
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,010
onto this.

58
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,190
This proposal from Watery Brown and others recommendations 

59
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,260
for specifying hidden friends So this was actually raised is 

60
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,230
a standard proposal for the benefit off other standards proposals so that they 

61
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,470
can consider using this technique to reduce the number of overloads that we 

62
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,540
we actually exposed to,

63
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,470
not just error messages but also compel times as well.

64
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,330
Having to consider all those additional overloads has a bit of a drag.

65
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,910
So I think really good they were going in the direction.

66
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,700
Whether you actually use this technique yourself is up to you because there is a 

67
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,630
trade off in that you do have to make them in line Friends of the 

68
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,150
class,

69
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,000
which may not have bean what you wanted to do.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,560
Otherwise,

71
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,550
there is another proposal,

72
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,250
the Independence of Declaration,

73
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,140
which proposes a new key word to actually allow you to do the same thing without 

74
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,000
changing how you design the code.

75
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,550
But do note the date of this proposal.

76
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,350
Mhm,

77
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,960
April the first thing this year.

78
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,820
I'm not saying that means anything,

79
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,770
but if you wanna go and have a look at that,

80
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,010
they get hobbling.

81
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,450
So that was it.

82
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,560
Thank you.
